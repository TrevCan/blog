# Hello there,

I've been trying out several bloggin systems but none of them seem to work
as I expect them. Well, to be frank, the only blogging systems I've been
trying are only Jekyll/Github based. The only thing I want is a nice 
[hacker-like](https://github.com/tocttou/hacker-blog) aesthethic because
why not and minimalist software that doesn't have a ton shit of folders like
Jekyll, **I just don't get why I can't add posts anywhere other than in `_posts/`!!**.

Also, this is a check to see if this post actually gets built because only the 
sample posts have appeared so far !!. **Edit**: You know what?, why not start
doing it right fucking know lol. I guess I'll create a test repo where I can idk
do shit and test `blogit`.
