Geohot Archive Links

Hello, this is just a list of useful links of geohot's hard-to-find (not
that hard actually) blogs. He actually still blogs but much much less
since he has a startup to take care of called [comma.ai](http://comma.ai).

- Geohot's current blog: [*geohot.github.io/blog/*](https://geohot.github.io/blog/)
- Jailbreak blog: from 2007 to 2009:
[*iphonejtag.blogspot.com, archived.*](https://web.archive.org/web/20090716104350/http://iphonejtag.blogspot.com/)
