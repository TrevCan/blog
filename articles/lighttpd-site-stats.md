Adding website stats

Maybe use webalizer ?
But apparently it's quite an old technology so it's not easy to use.

# solution!
Don't know how I did find it but it's [goaccess](https://goaccess.io/) and it
generates a nice html with graphs and numbers and works good enough.

You can access the current stats @ https://trevcan.duckdns.org/stats
and a handful of other sym-linked dirs. Can you find them all?

It can give you the total number of requests among many other things
including user agents and stuff. just random numbers but real actually.

from people and software interacting with a 2014 hp computer. wow.
