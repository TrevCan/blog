A relatable song.

A very relatable song. Just listen to the
crisp lyrics:

[Waste my Time - Crystal Casino Band](https://youtu.be/g5W7Dg_Lof4) (youtube)

Oddly enough, this song appeared as an _advert_ in an instagram story. I was just bored at a party after a while and I started using my phone and then lo and behold some radio frequencies that we humans interpret as sound and my brain - me - has appreciated it.

I've just never found such a relatable song as of now. Is this happiness ? Does it transfer sadness? Not sure, yet.
