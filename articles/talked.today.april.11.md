I talked with a human.

Nothing new, I guess.

Why am I making this blog post ? Well, I'm dumb.
No, I'm not dumb. I'm just trying to have an inner
conversation and some kind of introspection to understand
what is going on, man!

Why am I like this ?? 

Why do I self-sabotage ( is it with j or g ? oh yeah in
english it's definitely with `g`, right ? )  ??? !!!

Don't self-sabotage Hector!

You promised Tim that you'd be good enough and work
on time. He has been nothing less than tolerant with you ! 
And that's a good thing. Seems like a nice guy.

Honestly, some people warned me that it could be a scam and
that I'd be tutoring for free whilst he'd be selling ads on
the discord chat or whatever. ** But it isn't a scam!! **

This person is real. He works a real job. Kinda boring, but
not boring to death. But he created this foundation that
helps highschool kids learn programming and also career-changing
adults to learn technology and get into coding jobs.

So that's good. And I've met good people. Yet I have barely done
any work.

I promised Tim, I promised some friends I'd do stuff; yet I haven't
done it !! Why, hector ? 

Why are you still here ?!?! just writing this shit out on the
vim text editor which you think is cool because george hotz (a.k.a.
`geohot` or `t0mcr00se` ) talked about it **ONCE** on a recorded
live stream that you did not pay for and now I use it ! But it's
cool because I'm a Linux guy, right ? I think I got into Linux because
of George, so thanks for that george. And george was also the guy
who introduced my to tiling window managers when I was first starting
out with Linux.

I tried out XMonad, actually.

But **again**, why the fuck am I still writing here !?!?!?!

Just get to work, man! don't try to get people's attention if you don't
deserve it.

No, fortunately I'm not suicidal. Am I a pathological liar ? No, I
am a doer. Hector, you are a doer. You promise stuff.

When you don't achieve it, you should be honest with yourself and with
the people you promised it to. You should let them know that you're
a procrastinator - a professional procrastinator. Oh, God!
WHy would you even say that you are a *professional* procrastinator.?!?!?!?

What the hell does that even mean !? No, man. You are sabotaging yourself,
your relationships, your careeer. 

Calm the fuck down, Hector.

Put your server on a fucking etc/hosts file and get over it ! 

Just to brag, this is my `/etc/hosts` file right now: 

```
# Static table lookup for hostnames.
# See hosts(5) for details.
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1		localhost
127.0.0.1	t490-4rch.localdomain	t490-4rch	
0.0.0.0		news.ycombinator.com
0.0.0.0		lobste.rs
0.0.0.0		wikipedia.org
0.0.0.0		en.wikipedia.org
0.0.0.0		web.whatsapp.com
0.0.0.0		duckduckgo.com

```

that is all. Maybe i'll add my server here after pushing this blog post
and just ignore it. 

Today, I'll try to as be zen as possible.

Don't even spell-check this shit, man.

Mistakes are made, and you probably aready know that I'd have 
corrected them or maybe I did not or ma8ybe I will.jjj1
