Addicted to Black points

written on march 29th

I am addicted to [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com)

Or maybe I am just too much of an asshole to want to talk to my friends.

I don't have anything to say. I've recoursed back into using my phone
more often, and *not* leaving it behing. I used to leave it behind
when going to the bathroom, for a walk or just for anything, actually.

Yet today I was very worried. I really liked someone, I told her that
I liked her but she was in shock. I didn't see her again until like 
four hours later. I tried to talk to her but I guess she didn't want to.

So yeah, she does not like me. Yes, indeed.

Anyways, that has somewhat something to do with the black points over
the orange background. Yes, I am referring to hacker news. Specifically,
the points I have accumulated on my profile [0]. 

I've noticed that I do not enjoy reading the orange news anymore. Every
once in a while - more like a shit-more often than before - I've clicked
on the new section of news. Meaning, even news aren't 'that' ranked but they
appear almost as they are submitted by users all around the globe.

But I don't even find the normal hacker news ranked content nor the show
nor the ask nor the newest news hacker news relevant to me anymore.
Yet I check and check and check and check and check.

A few interesting articles here and there, but I don't finish them. They kinda
bore me to death.

Fortunately, my relationship with that person I was talking about is fine,
but yeah she's told me that I am not liked by her. But she's a very good
person and by no means I would like to ruin our friendship. You are a good
friend Astrid. You too Fatima, for reading my blog and being there and
teaching me chinese.

拜拜

I hope that means bye.
