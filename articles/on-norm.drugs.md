I drank coffee

Maybe this is placebo but point is I kind of am a distracted person
and feel like my heart is pounding relatively fast.

Yet today I decided to drink at seven in the `p.m.` one and a half
cups of american medium-roasted coffee from _Garat_. and i ate
it with some cookies. maybe too many cookies. Then I started
using my phone like a crazy person and started sending a shit-ton
of links to a friend. Maybe I went overboard with the links.

And the coffee kinda made me happy. I've never felt this alive before.

Like ideas just flow into my head and I execute them. Or maybe I'm just
being very reactive to my vices. Since, yes, being on instagram for like
five hours straight is not healthy. Also, I got on a call with another
friend and helped him out on a school project which I hadn't even started
at the time,
then got him to let me join his team. The code was
almost kind of done, and he made most of it. I feel bad for that. Kinda.

I don't know. But maybe without me he wouldn't have gotten the last
coding part. We barely saw any programming principles in class.

Also, is it ok to have for dinner only oatmeal with some granola ? And then
take antidepressants and an antibiotic ? I hope I don't fuck up my stomach.

My keyboard definitely makes a ton of noises when typing.
