I'm back!

Hello there! Well, I was technically always here
but guess what? My computer stopped working.

I think I messed up some docker (compose?) configuration
and it basically adds an IP address to a network 
interface which should be the one for my local area
network and my computer was probably confused where to route
incoming packets but I kinda just did a quick fix.

not sure if it'll survive after a reboot, since 
the problem has persisted (as of now) across
reboots. But yeah we're back.


### tldr
RTFM! [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_configuration#IP_addresses]
