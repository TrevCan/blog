Un beso en el asfalto. 2017

you should watch it.

spoilers ahead if that ain't obvious enough.

Hey there, I just watched the movie [Un beso en el asfalto (2017) *filmaffinity.com*](https://www.filmaffinity.com/mx/film644257.html)
and it was pretty cool. Weirdly enough, I think that it was hilarious that it
showed surprisingly different perspectives from all angles, even outside the
context of the movie. Hell, it even showed a threatre reading the script,
presenting it with props in front of an audience, and when they were recording
it. It was kinda like Shutter island in the sense that the end is whatever your
brain's interpretation is. So yeah, maybe I'll update this post idk.
