The film tests the boundaries at which we will conserve
and preserve and save _intimacy_. And _embarassment_. I guess
Danish women aren't expected to fart randomly at a supermarket or
in front of a male friend, are they ? Pretty embarassing if you
ask me. I don't understand why she didn't go to the store bathroom;
maybe there wasn't one...

Of course, we shall discuss other things. Like the fact that she
didn't want to tell her friend that she was actually busy and 
instead held a relatively long conversation with her friend.

I guess boundaries go a long way. Just as she did not have the trust
to say I have an emergency she might do that when not feeling safe.

It is impossible to determine how humans will work under a society
based on rules and social movements, structures, and just anything
at all. Like how do you define what's acceptable ? is it f'ing ok
to say "Hey I have to fucking poop, get out of the way!" ? I
would probably say that. Because I'm honest, sincere. I appreciate
honesty. I don't like to bluff. If someone wants me out of people's
private conversations and I'm there. I won't leave until these
people tell me. And if I get the cue that they're telling me
to gtfo, well then I will tell them ok but to just be direct.

I don't know what else to say. Seems like people put big effort into this film. 

It uses several examples of embarassment as away
to engage the viewer, or maybe not. Maybe that's the `5,4,3,2,1...` at the
beginning. That kinda gives us a feeling of fake nostalgia that never
happened. Because who's actually watched a real movie with those countdown
numbers. But now I'm criticizing myself for saying 'real movie'. what is
that, anyways? How do you define a good movie ? A good film ? Was
this a short film ? Or just a film ? Would it be bad to name this as 
a good film, who decides a good length for a film. Why should the amount
of effort matter or the amount of time or anything at all.

Humans **have reason**. Or a conscience, as we say. We are incapable
of imagining thoughts without being aware of the thoughts themselves.
Very weird indeed. And yet we live in society; we communicate
and have these complex hierarchy instructions that sometimes let 
us have more power, and therefore more control, and money. 

What is it that we ultimately want in life ? Don't know.

Maybe I went too far on this one. Let me know if this sucks or rocks!
