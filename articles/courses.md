### random recommendations

thisis a list of recommendations of courses, books, etc that I have most likely not looked at but kinda seems interesting or useful.

- book for learning operating systems: *Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. Andrew Tatenbaum*

- C for dummies by Dan Gookin


### coding bloat, maybe not?

I'm not a liar. I'll be sincere.
I have not checked any of these programming 'practice websites and don't really agree with the constant practice of problems after problems after problems. 

I think i checked out l33tcode but that was like 2 years ago and I don't see it necessary. I should write a blog post about this.
