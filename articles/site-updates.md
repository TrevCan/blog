Site updates

so we now have a new domain ! 

unless you read the mediagoblin post, read this ! 

visit me now @ [blog.thetrevor.tech](https://blog.thetrevor.tech)
to see my blog ! instead of the long kinda fishy domain `duckdns.org`.
Although it was a great start I now use `thetrevor.tech`.

I acquired it for a time of one year - for free btw. And the whole
domain is mine !

so yeah, I could write `thetrevor.thetrevor.tech` or literally
`mydomainforoneyear.thetrevor.tech` point is, I can now share 
my site just as `thetrevor.tech` and they'll see the main page of
my site.

same as <https://trevcan.duckdns.org/>

so yeah.

I got this through one of the github education offers with the `Dot-Tech`
domains company. By the way, I wasn't even able to change my account password.
This startup seems kinda fishy, but hey I got a free domain ! Their support 
never answered me. the domain interface is weird and ultimately, I do need
<https://duckdns.org> since it's what anyone who accesses <https://thetrevor.tech> has to check
since in the DNS record **is literally ** just an alias to <https://trevcan.duckdns.org>.

And right now I don't want the hastle of setting up a nameserver system. Since 
that's what <https://trevcan.duckdns.org> is acting as! dot-tech provides some name-servers
which I could in theory use but I don't think they have an API to rapidly change my 
_never-changing_ ip addresses.

So that's that.

I'm leaving some links below as well on some things that helped me set it up.

Also, you may now check my re-styled CSS `git` repo !<br>
now available @ <https://git.thetrevor.tech> ! 

Why do I sound like speaking broken english ! who know ? I don't speak like this, I hope.

# tldr

- new domain: `thetrevor.tech`
- <https://thetrevor.tech>
- <https://blog.thetrevor.tech>
- <https://git.thetrevor.tech>


I hope that by the end of this week I'll have a `videos.thetrevor.tech` set up so I can
upload any of my youtube videos to my computer and let anyone stream them from anywhere.

I'll probably be using peertube, it uses torrents, among other things; so I hope it doesn't
saturate my network.

Maybe I'll promote my blog, but I don't have any good ideas yet.

I also plan on explaining how I set up my website, from top to bottom; including my blog.

okay so bye.
