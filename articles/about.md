about:Trevcan

Hello there, I'm a human! 
I'm into programming, computers, and of course,
the beloved *linux* (I use [arch](http://archlinux.org) btw).
I like learning about new things, and enjoy riding
bikes, reading books such as 1984 (George Orwell), talking to people,
and breathing.

And yeah, I've decided to start writing / blogging so yeah this is me
attempting to set up a minimalist blogging system with blogit I guess
and a tad of github actions automation with gh pages.
