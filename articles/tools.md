# school

this section and subsections show tools that I may use or have 
found useful at some point. Includes links to proprietary software, etc.

## screen mirroring

- Apple TV software
- MirrorOP, installed on some school projectors, works over school's LAN
  - [MS Windows (10) app installer](https://www.barco.com/services/website/en/TdeFiles/Download?FileNumber=R33050099&TdeType=3&MajorVersion=2&MinorVersion=5&PatchVersion=4&BuildVersion=70&ShowDownloadPage=False) todo: add mirror
  - [iOS App](https://apps.apple.com/mx/app/mirrorop-presenter/id808539605)
  - Linux: no official version. But last time I tried installing the MS Windows executable through wine
and it worked like a charm! at least the screen sharing, I didn't test sound.
  - [official downloads page](https://www.barco.com/en/support/mirrorop/drivers)
  - last time i used this software the interface was somewhat laggy, the auto-lookup tool did not work and you had to enter the IP address of the project manually.
  - questions ? contact me.
  

## file transfer

one could use the usual google drive, dropbox, etc. No thanks, well, definitely useful when sharing between peers.

instead I use [snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net/) to transfer files over a LAN. although I must say last time I tried it on the school network it didn't work. I use it at my house to transfer scanned files from my phone to my computer without having to send emails.

Although not very privacy-respecting, I have used WhatsApp and its webapp. Their servers are extremely responsive for pdfs, unlike emails that may take minutes to arrive. I think files cap at 100 MB of file size.

# useless

not that they suck, but do they actually serve any purpose ?
But hey, remember that one man's trash can be another man's
glory (treasure).
