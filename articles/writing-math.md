Writing math in raw utf-8

So apparently linux lets you use the keybinding `Ctrl+Shift+U` to
insert utf-8 characters, literally any utf-8 character.

Why does this work ? No idea. Don't know if this comes directly
from the kernel but yeah, it works and I can type stuff like:

1 + 1 = âˆš2

yes, that's a square root symbol in raw unicode ! without using
microsoft word with a laggy interface or whatever.
