2019 - present: Learned Linux ! 
	also sysadmin stuff. 
	Set up a lighttpd web server.
				
	all my website and blog [3],[4],
				
	are hosted on an old computer connected to my home
	internet modem. 

	The computer runs Arch Linux and  its longest
	uptime has been 80d, 12h, 17m and counting !
	see for yourself!: [6]

	I use a dynamic DNS provider to set it up. Of course,
	
	I set up port forwarding to be able to set up the site
		over HTTP and HTTPS. Also set up SSH, among a few other ports.

	Also deployed cgit [5], a CGI web interface for viewing
	interactively and diffing different commits and projects.

	I also set up a git over HTTPs repository, on my own. Ton of work,
	web server configuration ain't easy at all!

	I'd love to set up my own peertube or odyssee instance but
	I've failed to do it. I also tried MediaGoblin but 
	containers are certainly hard ! Will update here if I get it
	working.

	
2022: Final Project for Advanced Programming High school class.
	We implemented a web application, using XAMPP,
	basically CRUD, allowing us to update and register
	exam evaluations. 
	It was done in pairs.
	There were data checks performed through javascript,
	then it would submit a form and PHP would register
	it to a MySQL database.
	Github Project: [2]
	
2021: (2 weeks) Cyber Security Externship at WorkED. 
	Done virtually due to pandemic. 
	Learned about frameworks to make reports and main
	strategies to combat bad actors.
	Worked with real pen-testing tools, Linux, learned about SQL injections.
	Talked to several cybersecurity experts in 
	several fields (private, public).
	Worked with rangeforce platform (<https://rangeforce.com>).
	Made professional reports about previous 
	vulnerabilities, worked in teams, made new relationships.

	
	
	
2018 August - [present]: Member of TECBOT Robotics Team. 
	Competes against other 
	highschools, national and international in FRC. 
    I am a member of the software 
	team and have led the teaching of new students who learn 
	Java Programming for FRC. 
    Our code is on github: [0].
    See also: Our Code for the 2022 FRC Season: [8]

2019: Workshop: â€¢The Science Behind Technological Design: A 
	Human-Centered Approach. 
	With Monica Perusquia as instructor.
	1 week. Undergrad and high school (me) students. 
	First time I installed Linux (Ubuntu) ! Got me very interested.
	Learned Linux, teamwork, reading software documentation, 
	tried out python with some ML. 
	We made a prototype to measure a person's posture + stress 
	+ haptic feedback.
			
2019: Hackathon Fintech Workshop. In collaboration
	with Banca Mifel. Mostly undergraduate students from
	business, engineering, and tech careers. Learned about
	Unity3D, played around with NodeJS and some database engines.
	72 hours.
	In Teams.

2022 (August) - 2026 ?: Undergraduate Computer Science Engineering Degree.
	haven't started yet, but very excited!
	@ Monterrey Technological Institute. Campus Toluca
	
2019 - 2022: PrepaTec Multicultural (PTM) (3 years) (Classes in English 
	and learned French)
