Speed running today

context: go to end of document.

Hello. I woke up several times and tried to sleep and turned off my shitty alarms.

Eventually, Joe called. I answered. I understood, my voice was clearly fucked up.
I think I'm dehydrated. 

Then an alarm started to sound at the same time I was taking the phone call !
What a silly design choice, Apple ! Then I woke up,
went to the bathroom, tried not to die.

I then started committing a lot of changes. Then I pushed. And I pushed.

I got 500'ed by github. What a shame. Github is my go-to remote git provider.
It works over https, aka firewalls don't tell me no. I had some respect for Github.

But I had to push this as fast as I could. So I ssh'ed into my home server,
then created a bare git repo and pushed to that.

Since my friend is in a proxy plus firewalle'd network, he couldn't use his ssh keys
so I sent him a link to this: 

```
https://git.trevcan.duckdns.org/RobotCode_2022.git/
```

And that works over https ! Push doesn't work over http/(s) but yeah. He was
able to pull in no time and could get my code. So that's good I guess.

morning and I haven't attended any of my high school courses. I should go to
tecbot.

Ok, bye
