Information Flow

Oh my God ! It's my last day of school ! Well, I still
have another day tomorrow but we're practically doing nothing!
I still have like 3 final exams that I'll be doing this Friday
or the next week.

But whateveeeer ! Today I've given myself the day.
I had a 'fiesta de cereal' (yes, a cereal party) ! 
Everyone just brought a ton of sugary cereals, milk, almond milk,
other kinds of liquids that are called milk but I don't think
are actually milk, toppings, spoons, bowls, and glasses for drinking
and apparently serving the cereal !? 

But it didn't really feel that good. I feel kinda bad because I 
was supposed to bring cereal and other stuff but I did not. 

But now I feel bored. Yet with self-guilt, because I am not doing
what I am supposed to. I have some not-yet-done calculus assignments
that are not difficult, yet too easy. And that doesn't motivate me 
to keep on going. I've probably already passed the subject, and now 
I just need to take the final exam and if I want finish those
calculus exercises. Which will most likely serve as practice, which
does help.

But why am I here? Just to suffer ? Who knooowwws mate! Also, I watched
a tv show for the first time in a while. And with another human
being. With a friend, actually. I watched the 2nd episode of 
Mr. Robot (2016).
I've already finished the show, yes, the whole four seasons. It really
brings out very dark yet astonishing thoughts within your mind. I
don't want to talk about it because I could spoil it. If you want 
to watch it it's available on amazon prime. But hey, if you don't 
want to give your money to one of the biggest e-commerce shopping
conglomerates around the world just send me an e-mail and maybe I'll
let you copy off the downloaded episodes I have. (Don't worry, I
still pay for amazon prime and I did watch it there first so -some -
money will definitely be going to the actors/director, etc...) 

And the scenes. The writing style of the show. Very beautiful. Or
maybe I'm just so fucking biased and I praise this show like 
no other because I haven't watched that many dramas. Well, I've also
watched House M.D. Yep, the whole eight seasons, baby! It gets boring
after a while. But point is, Mr. Robot is. And if you want you 
may watch it, but I must say it does include sensitive and/or
disturbing content.

But that's what a good show is, right ? One that actually questions 
your being, existence and merely mixes you in with the feelings
and does not merely end and your mind says: "Oh well we're done here."
No, your mind **Will want more**!.

I think that's enough blogging for today, plus dependencies.

So no, I'm not done bloggging yet.

# dependencies

Dependencies are weird. This is some kind of buzz-word. A real
one, actually. It stands for what it means. At least in software.
A software, a program, or a set of programs, may depend upon other
programs to function. Libraries, let's say. Frameworks, etc...

And there's this thing called dependency hell, from the internet
discussions I've read it's mostly within the front-end web developing
space. But it could also happen in the backend. Certain software
requires certain, very specific, cryptic - even -, 
versions of the software and sometimes software collides with other
software. Libraries are just collections of minified code (sometimes
not even minified) or maybe even compiled and using a shared library. 
But there's just a gigantic web of tech stacks that we utilize on a
daily basis. That is why I strive for minimalism within my life. 

Although sometimes extreme minimalism may lead to extreme dependencies,
which I am trying to - most definitely - get away from. Are friends
dependencies ? definitely !! They most of the time are. We sometimes
need them. Friends are there when needed, right ? But sometimes
they're always needed. Of course, that is bad, that's dependency hell.

Sometimes your thoughts wander way too much and you don't have time
to talk that much to people yet you'd love to talk more and more and
more yet time is of the essence. And so is my life and so is theirs.

But generating dependencies is sometimes bad. when some of the code
is very simple to make, but tedious, you may go to using libraries.
But if a develper rants about not being paid enough money and
shutting down all his very minimalist packages and shutting down
very popular web services that says that something's very wrong
in the developer space. Not only for the fact that this guy's not
being paid enough ( which is meh ), but also because the developers
who were using **his** code did not plan ahead.

But hey, take my comments with a fucking grain of salt cause I'm
still in high school if that counts. But maybe I'll get a headstart,
I'm trying to get an internship.
