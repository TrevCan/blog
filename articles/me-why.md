$ whoami


Well, **who am I?**

I wanted to start off by explaining the `whoami` Linux (gnu coreutils) command first. But I'm sure it's self explanatory. Computer systems have users. The command just prints who is the user running the command.

But well... who am I ? That's one of
philosophy's most-searched questions.
I must warn you, I may just be saying random shit here because I'm bored 
and I just like writing
