$ whoami

Well, **who am I?**

Well, that's a great question. I don't really know myself.

If you know french, here is a reflexion essay I made in highschool for my
philosophy course:

I wanted to start off by explaining the `whoami` Linux (gnu coreutils) command first. But I'm sure it's self explanatory. Computer systems have users. The command just prints who is the user running the command.

But well... who am I ? That's one of
philosophy's most-searched questions.
