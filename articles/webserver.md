web servers useful links

not a real article, just a list of links.

Might do a writing on this some day.

You can view my simple webserver in C @

all requests with at least that are passed from lighttpd to the webserver.

I coded in something to show you the headers your browser is sending:
[https://trevcan.duckdns.org/short/head](https://trevcan.duckdns.org/short/head)

maybe I'll post the code.
