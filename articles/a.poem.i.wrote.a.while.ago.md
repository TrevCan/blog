No: a Poem by <em><small>yours truly</small></em>

Oh my, oh my,<br>
with no path for myself,<br>
I got nowhere but the void to go to,<br>
overinformed by everyone,<br>
just wanting to go to the snow,<br>

Oh my, Oh my,<br>
what a free world we live in,<br>
is society doomed?<br>
or am I?<br>

Should i live by critique?<br>
Or by desire?<br>
am I good enough for you?<br>
Is this right?<br>
this wrong?<br>
like this?<br>
like that?<br>
I'm a lazy human for not doing my part!<br>

is there an end?<br>
am I dying?<br>
feels more awkward everyday...<br>
rarely entertaining...<br>

oh my oh my,<br>
I love my nationality,<br>
but rarely do I feel identified,<br>
am I American?<br>
Mexican?<br>
rarely do I with humans near me,<br>
I don't even know any anthem by heart!<br>
I should work harder, but not that much!<br>
or I'll become a workaholic!<br>
and maybe will be called a psycho!<br>

should I stop contemplating?<br>
and just do stuff?<br>
maybe... maybe not.<br>

`THE END`
