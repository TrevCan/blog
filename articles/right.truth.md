Sometimes the truth hurts

Yes, sometimes the truth hurts.

Especially if you have something to do with it.

Truth is weird. Humans lie. I try not to lie. I try to be
plainly honest most of the time. I try not to cheat on 
exams. I try not to look at the exam answers even when my
friends would give them all to me without any academic 
repercussions.

But when the truth affects your past, your situation,
your view of life. You kinda die inside. You oughtta accept
that sometimes you just aren't right and maybe you're
fucking wrong.

I fucked up, I guess. I think that you were definitely right,
Gaby. No problem. But it is hard accepting the truth.

End.
