Okay, fine. The DLL injection
on the windows 10 uninstaller
is a fair vulnerability. 

But what the hell happened to 'I own my machine'. I can take pride
in fucking up and accepting my own decisions !?!?

where's the unix philosophy at ?


since when do I have to own a git repo to look at it? Wasn't this **the**
decentralized control versioning system created by Linus Torvalds?
The one that he kinda made in about 2 weeks but has been the top CVS for what ?, more
than 12 years now ? 

I mean, this is an absurd decision.
Hundreds of CI/CD (Continuous integration / Continuous delivery ).

Even my fucking **simple** AF git hooks died. Since I am running
as another more-unprivileged user
now I don't have the right to clone a repo who's owned by another user in the system ? Seriously,
what the hell is wrong with that !?

This is, in my opinion, certainly
a stupid decision.
