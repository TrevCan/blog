What are names anyway ?

just about four minutes ago I stumbled upon a good friend of mine, Nacho. He was with her friend, Betzabé. I couldn't remember the name. Nor did she remember mine. So we did not salute. Then Cindy arrived. I did remember Cindy's name. Then I asked them about where the *Auditorium 1* was. Apparently I had fucked up. It was in the high school building, not in undergrad. Then I told Betzabe hello, and sincerely said that I couldn't remember her name. "Betzabé", she told me. She confessed she didn't remember mine either.

So this story / blog post shall be meant to be used for future reference when trying to remember Betzabè's name. Betzabé. *Betzabé*. **Betzabé**. ***Betzabé***. Her name is Betzabé. Almost all of the times I've encountered Nacho I've also encountered with Betzabé. Weird name. Three syllables. or Betza, maybe ? Nah, I'll confuse her with someone who's actually referred to as Betza. Are you though ? Are you referred to as Betza, Betzabé ?

Who knows, lol. Just a fun story I felt like writing I guess. Back to the
`always-late-cause-we're-inmexico-and-stuff.`

Bye.
