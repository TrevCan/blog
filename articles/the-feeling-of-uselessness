The feeling of Uselessness


# i feel useless

yes, indeed I do.
Even though I can provide ideas, experiencie and opinions within
my area of expertise,
I do not fill fulfilled.

I feel **not useful**. I am
trying to teach someone something
but they really don't get it!
They barely get it at all!
You are a good person, kinda trying
to understand but you're not at all putting in the effort.
I explain, you look at me in deception and
I try to explain but you barely make
any questions.

I had already teached you some
of this which means that you
are either a) very distracted and
not interested in learning about
this topic; b) you don't like me,
you're thinking of something bad
or arrogant I made; or c) your
incentives to learn are
non-existant.

That is bad. Any of these problems
is bad. Some worse than others.
Communication **is key**. Yet 
you don't say shit.

You don't seem to want to learn.
I think I'm trying my best in 
order to teach but neither
am I inspired at all. I don't
like working for tyrants.

And you know, after being absent
on a team and being occupied at
other things - for several hours -
I can tell you that my opinions are
not valuable to the team. I try
to give ideas, let others be yet
the design we were working on
went to fucking trash and we started
doing everything from the start.

And I truly try to help but none
of the actions I critique are valuated. I can say good job or whateved but at this point I'm
practically nonexistent.
