Nice website

After reading one of the top posts on Ask HN this day, I stumbled upon this
blog search engine, known as [blogsurf](https://blogsurf.io/). It's a blog
search engine.

Small community. 200 blogs ! oh my god, that's nothing! Anyways, eventually
I saw one of the top blogs
and stumbled upon [waitbutwhy.com](https://waitbutwhy.com/).

The articles seem promising, I read a couple but got to the middle of
each one and then left. Eventually, I clicked on the 'about' page and started
reading the 'wait but who'. Very meta web-site. This about page acknowledges
the hurdles of maintaining a website whilst working a (maybe?) full-time job.

3 members apparently. They seem funny.

Some articles that I think seem promising but I actually haven't read:
- [why i can't post on time](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/cant-post-on-time.html)
- [religion for the non-religious](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html)
- and of course, the funny faq page: [faq](https://waitbutwhy.com/faq)
